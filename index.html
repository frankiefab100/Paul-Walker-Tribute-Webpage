              <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p>
                Paul William Walker IV was born on September 12, 1973, in
                Glendale, California, to American parents with mostly English,
                as well as German, Swiss, and Irish ancestry. His mother, Cheryl
                (n√©e Crabtree), was a fashion model, and his father, Paul
                William Walker III, was a sewer contractor and former amateur
                boxer, who was a two-time Golden Gloves champion. Walker's
                paternal grandfather, William, had a short-lived boxing career
                as "'Irish' Billy Walker", while another raced factory cars for
                Ford in the 1960s. Raised a Mormon,Walker had four younger
                siblings: Aimee, Ashlie, Caleb, and Cody. He spent the majority
                of his early life in the Sunland neighborhood of Los Angeles,
                and graduated from Village Christian School in 1991. Walker
                subsequently attended several community colleges in Southern
                California, majoring in marine biology. Walker began his career
                as a child actor during the 1970s and 1980s, and gained
                recognition in the early 1990s after appearing in the television
                soap opera The Young and the Restless. He received praise for
                his performances in the teen film She's All That and the
                coming-of-age film Varsity Blues (both 1999), before gaining
                international fame after starring in The Fast and the Furious
                (2001). Walker then starred in the commercially successful road
                thriller Joy Ride (2001), which led to a reputation as an action
                star. This continued with his performances in box-office
                disappointments Into the Blue (2005) and Running Scared (2006).
                Walker also earned praise in other genres, like in the survival
                drama Eight Below, and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen the war
                film Flags of Our Fathers (both 2006). Outside of these, Walker
                then largely appeared in low budget action films, but starred in
                the commercially successful heist film Takers (2010). Walker
                died on
                November 30, 2013 at the age of 40 as a passenger
                in a single-car crash alongside friend and driver Roger Rodas
                thought to be caused by driving into a gas pipe. Walker's father
                and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against
                Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his
                death, Walker had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015), which
                was completed after rewrites and stand-ins, including his
                brothers Cody and Caleb, filled in for Walker. The song "See You
                Again" by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned for the
                film's soundtrack as a tribute to Walker.
